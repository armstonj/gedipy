# GEDIPy
Python tools for processing of NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) H5 data products. 

Drivers for data products from NASA's ICESat-2 and LVIS missions are included for purposes of fusion and cal/val.

This code is not "official" mission code and is not used in the generation of any GEDI products.
It's not actively updated, or well documented, but may have snippets or notebooks that are of interest to some.

Install GEDIPy directly from GitHub:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/armstonj/gedipy
```
